Sure! Here's a simple Python mini-game — a Number Guessing Game — that's fun and easy to run in a terminal or command prompt:

import random

def number_guessing_game():
    print("Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!")
    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)
    attempts = 0

    while True:
        try:
            guess = int(input("Guess a number between 1 and 100: "))
            attempts += 1

            if guess < number_to_guess:
                print("Too low! Try again.")
            elif guess > number_to_guess:
                print("Too high! Try again.")
            else:
                print(f"Congratulations! You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.")
                break
        except ValueError:
            print("Please enter a valid number.")

number_guessing_game()

This game picks a random number between 1 and 100, and you try to guess it. You get hints whether your guess is too low or too high.
